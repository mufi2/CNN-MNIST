# ðŸ§  MNIST Digit Recognition using CNN

An advanced **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model for accurately recognizing handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. This project combines a powerful model training pipeline and an interactive web application built with Streamlit for real-time predictions.

---

## ðŸ“– Introduction
This project leverages CNNs to classify handwritten digits, offering a precise solution for the MNIST classification challenge. Using this model, images of digits from 0-9 are recognized with high accuracy, making it suitable for educational purposes, exploratory data science, and model deployment.

## ðŸ§¬ Model Architecture
The CNN model architecture comprises:
- **Two Convolutional Layers** with ReLU activations, each followed by Max Pooling.
- **Fully Connected Layer** for final classification, mapping features to digit classes.
- **Softmax Activation** to produce a probability distribution across the 10 digit classes.
